This directory is for creating Verilog files for the "AWSteria_Core"
sub-system for an AWSteria_RISCV_Virtio system.

The top-level generated module here is 'mkAWSteria_Core' (in file
mkAWSteria_Core.v).  This module is instantiated inside module
mkAWSteria_System in the AWSteria_RISCV_Virtio system.

// ================================================================
***** IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! *****

FOR CORRECT USE OF THIS GENERATED VERILOG, PLEASE PEFORM THE FOLLOWING
CONSISTENCY CHECKS WITH THE AWSteria_RISCV_Virtio ENVIRONMENT INTO
WHICH mkAWSteria_Core WILL BE INSTANTIATED!

* The interface for module mkAWSteria_Core must be consistent with
    the interface expected by mkAWSteria_System.

    For the BSV interface see source files:
        Flute/src_Core/AWSteria_Core/AWSteria_Core_IFC.bsv
        Flute/src_Core/Debug_Module/DM_Common.bsv
        Flute/src_Core/ISA/PC_Trace.bsv
        Flute/src_Core/ISA/TV_Info.bsv

    For the Verilog interface, see the generated Verilog file:
        ./Verilog_RTL/mkAWSteria_Core.v.
    (this is generated by bsc from the BSV interface).

* The address map assumed by this core must be consistent with the
    address map of the overall AWSteria_RISCV_System hardware, and
    with the address map of Linux/software running on Flute.

    The file  Flute/src_Core/AWSteria_Core/SoC_Map.bsv
    specifies the (partial) address-map built into mkAWSteria_Core.

// ----------------

The Verilog generated here depends on other Verilog modules in the 'bsc'
    (Bluespec BSV compiler) library.  You will need them when building
    the full AWSteria_RISCV_Virtio system.  They can be found in the
    bsc repo:
        https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc
    in the directory:
        bsc/src/Verilog/
